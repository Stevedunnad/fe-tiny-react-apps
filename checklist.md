## Planning

[ x] Copy this list into your project<br>
[ x] Outline functionality of your app<br>

- Ability to add and remove tasks from a list
- Possibly ability to cross them off
- Possibly ability to set due and rank by due date

[x ] Draw what the user will see<br>
[x ] Break out components from your sketch<br>

- H1?
- Add task button
- Input box for tasks
- Remove task button
- Tasks list (ul)

[x ] Name your components<br>

- Title
- AddTask
- TaskInput
- RemoveTask
- ListTasks

[ x] Draw component hierarchy<br>

All components first-level children of the app

[x ] Label where you will require functions that change state<br>

- Buttons will have event handlers that change state in the app

[ x] Label where you will require data<br>

- TasksInput box will require data from user

[ x] Determine from this where you will require state & hold functions<br>

- state lives in the app
- functions defined in components and called in app

## Setup

[x ] Create your app directory (e.g. with create-react-app)<br>
[x] Run your app<br>
[x ] Ensure you have React DevTools running (in browser)<br>
[ ] Make blank components (functional or class?) as per your plan<br>
[ ] Export and import components as per your hierarchy<br>
[ ] Check everything is hooked up<br>

## Further functionality

[ ] Flesh out your components with methods - this is a pretty big step!<br>

## Style

[ ] Add classNames<br>
[ ] Create and import .css file(s)
